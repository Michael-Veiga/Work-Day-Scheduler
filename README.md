# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to make an application that allows the user to save an event for each hour of the day. The app will also color code each time block to indicate if the current time is greater than, less than or equal to the current time.
Finally, the app will store any inputs to local storage if the save button is clicked.
The app runs in the browser and and uses dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Summary 
This assignment was relatively straight forward, however the syntax of the if statements and storage input events we're quite challenging at times. My tutor was instrumental in helping me to understand how to use the parent and sibling attributes effectively, as well as the appropriate usage for parseInt. I referenced the layout of another day-planner's script.js which was extremely helpful, however it had many problems of its own. This is honestly the first homework where i've fully comprehended the efficiency of dry code over wet code.
